# Atlassian DC Pricing

The DC pricing for Atlassian products are not exposed via a public REST API, so cannot be consumed systematically.

This repo is an attempt to resolve this, as it relies on manual updates, it's accuracy should not be relied upon, though reasonable efforts will be made to update the data based on known changes. If you notice any of the data is wrong, please PR.
